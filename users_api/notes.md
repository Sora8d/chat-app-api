Notes
    - Test coverage of users_service_test is 68%
    - Once the oauth api has begun developing, integrate authentication.
    - Various functions of the service return stuff thats not being sent back to the client, fix that. And one of the protoc functions (createUser) exepcts an userprofile that at the end im not going to give
    - Need to set up the metadata
